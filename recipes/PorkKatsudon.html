          You might not want to be a pork cutlet, but with this recipe you can
          totally eat a pork cutlet! And, really, what could be more desirable
          than a steaming bowl of rice, breaded pork cutlet, onions, and egg.
          Funnily enough, katsu and the word for victory are pronounced the same
          in Japanese (カツ and 勝つ, respectively), so athletes will often eat
          some katsudon before or after they compete. So, in honor if Yuri
          Katsuki’s birthday, make some tasty katsudon!
