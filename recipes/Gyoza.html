    <p>
      Gyoza are Japanese pan-fried dumplings filled with a savory mix of minced
      meat (usually pork), cabbage, garlic, ginger, and spring onions. Crispy on
      the bottom and juicy inside, they’re typically served with a tangy
      soy-vinegar dipping sauce and make a perfect appetizer or side dish.

    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp cornflour</li>
      <li>26 ready-made gyoza skins</li>
      <li>2-3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 spring onions</li>
      <li>2 large leaves of Savoy</li>
      <li>1½cm piece of ginger</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove</li>
      <li>50g water chestnuts</li>
      <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp cooking saké</li>
      <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tsp peanut oil</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the spring onions, cabbage, ginger and garlic in a food processor,
        and whizz to a fine mix (or finely chop by hand).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the water chestnuts and pulse to chop, but not too finely – these
        will add a nice crunchy texture. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sake,
        sesame oil and a pinch of salt, and whizz again.
      </li>

      <li>
        Tip the ingredients into a bowl and add the minced pork or chicken. Mix
        by hand until well combined. Chill until ready to use.
      </li>

      <li>
        Have a pot of water to hand. Sprinkle the cornflour onto a plate. To
        assemble the gyoza, hold the dumpling skin in the palm of one hand and
        put a heaped teaspoon of the filling onto the centre of the skin.
      </li>

      <li>
        Dip your finger in the water and wipe around the edge of the skin – this
        will moisten it and help the edges stick together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the edges of the skin together. Pinch pleats along one side, then
        press each pleat against the opposite flat side of the skin. With each
        pinch make sure that you are sealing the parcel and keeping the filling
        in the centre. Put each gyoza onto the plate dusted with cornflour. Can
        be covered with cling film and chilled for up to 8 hrs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the gyoza in batches. Heat a non-stick frying pan with 1 tbsp
        vegetable oil. Brush off any excess cornflour from the bases of the
        dumplings. Fry the gyoza on one side only – don’t turn them over, you
        just want one crispy side. They should be golden brown after about 2
        mins.
      </li>

      <li>
        Mix all the dipping sauce ingredients and serve alongside the dumplings
        in dipping bowls. You can serve with both or just one dipping sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
